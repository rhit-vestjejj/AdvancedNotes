Meeting about best man duties at 2pm

I am writing my best man speech for Cheryl and Roel's wedding. I am just staring this and it's going okay. I have the outline done. I am going to keep working on it. They are getting married the 30th of august. 

After that outline I started to work on this AdvancedNotes project a bit more just adding some random small stuff like CSS and making it look all pretty and start ideating on what else I want to add to this.
